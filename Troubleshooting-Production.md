### The site is down, what do I do?

1. Is [Heroku having an incident](https://status.heroku.com/)?
2. Are any errors reported on the [app metrics](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/metrics) widget on the apps dashboard?
3. Are there any exceptions and stack traces appearing in the [Heroku logs](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/logging#view-logs-with-the-heroku-dashboard)?
4. Are any serious issues at the top of the error tracker in [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/)?
