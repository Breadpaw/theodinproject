### Adding a New Lesson

#### 1. Adding the Lessons Attributes
1. Go to `db/fixtures/lessons` and choose the appropriate file that the lesson should go in.
2. Add the new lessons attributes to the bottom of the list.
3. ** **Important** ** Make sure to give the lessons `identifier_uuid` attribute a value of `'create_uuid'`. This will be replaced by a real uuid automatically when the seed script is run later.

This is what your new lesson attributes should look like when you are done:
```
},
  'Your New Lesson Title' => {
    title: 'Your New Lesson Title',
    description: 'This is a new lesson',
    github_path: '/foundations/new_lesson_github_path.md',
    identifier_uuid: 'create_uuid',
  },
}
```

#### 2. Add the Lesson to a Course.
1. First find the path you want to add the lesson to in `db/fixtures/paths/`
2. Next find the course in that path you want the lesson to appear in `db/fixtures/paths/<selected_path>/courses/`
3. When you have found the correct path and course, you next have to find the section within that course you want the lesson to be in.
4. When you have found the correct section simply add the lesson to the section by fetching the lesson using the title you provided in the attributes in step one of this guide:

**Note: The order of the lessons matter. They will display on the website in the same order.**
```
section.add_lessons(
  foundation_lessons.fetch('Existing Lesson'),
  foundation_lessons.fetch('My New Lesson'),
)
```

#### 3. Verify the Lesson has been Successfully Added

1. Run the seeds task `bin/rails db:seed`
2. Run the app locally and check the lesson is where it should be.
3. All done ðŸŽ‰
